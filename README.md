## Blazeface Concentration Analysis by Detecting Facial Features on Web

![sample](./sample.gif)

This repository contains simple concentration scoring algorithm && Blazeface Tensorflow2.0 implementation. (High score means lack of concentration)

- web environment
- real-time
- face detection
- facial feature(landmark) detection
- concentration scoring

### Blazeface Implementation

Please check out ./detect_model directory

### Facial Landmark Detection

Used pretrained tfjs [PFLD](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/pfld-a-practical-facial-landmark-detector) model

### How To

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Dependencies

```
npm v6.14.5
yarn v1.22.4
nodejs v14.5.0
```
